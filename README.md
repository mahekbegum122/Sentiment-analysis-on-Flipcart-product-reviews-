Software Requirements

Python (latest version)
Libraries:
pandas â†’ data manipulation
numpy â†’ numerical operations
re â†’ regular expressions
matplotlib & seaborn â†’ data visualization
scikit-learn â†’ ML models and evaluation
wordcloud, nltk â†’ text preprocessing

IDE: Jupyter Notebook / PyCharm / VS Code

Dataset: Flipkart reviews dataset (text + sentiment labels)

ðŸ§  Methodology
Data Collection â€“ Import and store Flipkart review data
Data Preprocessing â€“ Clean text, remove noise, and tokenize
Feature Extraction â€“ Convert text to vectors using TF-IDF
Model Training â€“ Train ML models (SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
Evaluation â€“ Compare models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
Visualization â€“ Plot confusion matrices and sentiment distributions

ðŸ§© System Design
The system is modular with these components:
Input Data Module â€“ Loads raw reviews
Preprocessing Module â€“ Cleans and tokenizes text
Feature Extraction Module â€“ Converts text to numerical form (TF-IDF)
Model Training Module â€“ Trains and tunes ML models
Prediction & Voting Module â€“ Combines model outputs via majority voting
Evaluation Module â€“ Assesses model performance visually and statistically

ðŸ“Š Results
Model	Accuracy	Highlights
SVM	High	Great for high-dimensional data but slight confusion between neutral & negative
Random Forest	High	Balanced precision and recall, reduced overfitting
Gradient Boosting	Highest	Excellent precision and recall across all sentiments

âœ… Final Ensemble (SVM + RF + GB) outperformed individual models with improved accuracy and robustness.
Most reviews were positive, indicating overall customer satisfaction.
